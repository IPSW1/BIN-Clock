# BIN-Clock

This simple binary clock is controlled by an ATtiny2313. For reasons of simplicity an external 8MHZ crystal is used instead of a RTC module.  
The time is shown by overall 11 multiplexed LEDs, five for the hours and 6 for minutes, and is set by two buttons for hours and minutes respectively.  
Below are a few pictures of the clock:
